                <p>The CPU, often referred to as the "brain" of the computer, handles all the instructions from programs and applications running on a computer. It performs the basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output operations specified by the instructions in the software.</p>

                <h2>Key Features of a CPU</h2>
                <ul class="tablet-desktop">
                    <li>Clock Speed: Measured in GHz, it determines how many cycles the CPU can perform per second.</li>
                    <li>Core Count: CPUs can have multiple cores, allowing them to process multiple instructions simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>Cache: High-speed memory inside the CPU that stores frequently used data for faster access.</li>

                <h1>Additional Information</h1>
                <p>Here are some additional tips and resources to learn more about CPUs and their role in computing.</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Overclocking</dt>
                    <dd>Overclocking refers to increasing the clock speed of a CPU beyond the manufacturer's specifications to achieve better performance. This process can boost performance in CPU-intensive tasks but comes with increased heat generation and potential risks to the hardware.</dd>

                    <dt>Multi-core Processing</dt>
                    <dd>Modern CPUs come with multiple cores, allowing them to perform multiple tasks at once. More cores generally mean better performance in multi-threaded applications such as video editing, rendering, and high-end gaming.</dd>

                    <dt>Thermal Management</dt>
                    <dd>CPUs generate heat during operation. Efficient cooling solutions, such as heat sinks and fans, are essential to prevent overheating and ensure optimal performance.</dd>
